iPhone13ProMax_issue

- The display has strong pink hue when viewed from the side-angles
- The display has an irregular refresh rate, producing scrolling "artifacts and jitter"
- The color of the display is not to standard
- The iPhone "settings" app is unsure of display as genuine & authentic
- Watching video (recorded on the phone at 24fps), the footage is so jittery it looks like 14 fps. I have to record at 60fps to get a less sloppy "less jittery" performance

I think is a refurbished iPhone with an unsatisfactory repair state…
I would like a refund or exchange to another phone (if you have any which are found satisfactory).

I came back to the shop on the same day I purchased the phone, unhappy with the refurbished screen.
I told them I want a refund. They say they cannot refund because there is no defect.

BEFORE PURCHASE:
- I was unaware the display was not only counterfeit/non-genuine,  but that it had significantly ‘decreased properties’,(brightness, color, refresh-rate, etc.)
- After requesting a refund [SUN 20 JUL @1740hrs] was finally told the display was not "genuine OLED", but in fact "LCD". The cheap type of LCD which changes color significantly at large viewing angles.
- I was unaware the device was refurbished. After snooping though the settings app, I found not only had the display been replaced, but a ‘battery’ and ‘camera module’ had also been replaced.
- This device seemed like a fair deal as other devices on trade me had sold for similar prices [[    Screenshot+     https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/iphone/iphone-13/listing/5418423801    https://web.archive.org/web/20250720080455/https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/iphone/iphone-13/listing/5418423801    ]]. Those other devices were non-refurbished however, and so my judgement was that the "device sold to me was comparable" in not only price but aspects such as whether the phone had been refurbished.

AFTER PURCHASE
- After refund was refused by seller, I had found their stock on trademe. Here the item is properly described…     ScreenShot+.        https://web.archive.org/web/20250720081416/https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/iphone/iphone-13-pro-max/listing/5426534915 
- I realise I was never aware of these alterations (which are visible clearly on trademe) made to the phone.
- I realise that the device in its current state "does not offer all of the features of a ‘normal’ and ‘complete’ phone would", especially when using apple’s "phone-comparison tool"  [[ ScreenShot+ /web/20250720084608/https://www.apple.com/ph/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-13-pro-max,iphone-13,iphone-16-pro-max ]]
