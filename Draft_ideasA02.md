# The "iPhone 13 Pro Max" purchase

---




<br>
<br>

## The story:

<br>


`Date: 2025-07-21 at 2:52PM`\
I purchased an **iPhone 13 Pro Max** from **Kool Zone** for **$999.00**\
(The transaction total is $1011.50; which includes a tempered-glass screen-protector for $12.50 - not-pursued).


\
Initially, I told the shop attendant I wanted to purchase a phone for making YouTube videos. I indicated an interest in using an iPhone 13 Pro Max for video, as there were some of these model iPhone on the shop-display.\
I also have experience using my Father's iPhone 13 ("standard edition"/not a 'Pro Max' model) to film various videos. Some of these activities filmed included sports, home maintenance/renovation, and product videography/photography.\
\
I briefly took a look at the phone with the shop attendant. I glanced over the video controls, and determined that I must read the documentation of the iPhone 13 Pro Max from internet sources (including Apple's own documentation) to test the 'most impressive' or 'highest valued' videography aspects. So I said, "I would do some reading on my own cellphone, and come back in a few minutes".\
After 5-10 minutes, I returned and activated the pertaining video options - such as `4K video resolution, HDR 10-bit color, Apple ProRes format , (4K) 60/30 frames per second`.\
\
\
Everything seemed okay in the store. "For a brief second I did notice the display had very mild jitter", but I thought it was inconsistent with how the phone would perform continuously after this point, and that this hard-to-see "laggy behavior" was possibly my eyesight "lacking clarity" in the lighting of the mall, combined with a phone that may be running some background tasks at the time.\
The factors such as the lighting in the mall, and the brief opportunity I had to realise this fault, made it far-less apparent to me at the time of purchase.

>To put things in perspective... My Father owns an iPhone13 (standard/non-pro), and I did spend a lot of time using the camera app, as well as occasionally teaching him how to use it. *I experienced very smooth display performance on his device.*

>the "iPhone13 (standard edition)" does not come with 120 frames-per-second ***pro-motion*** display. ***the "iPhone13 Pro", "iPhone 13 Pro Max" both contain "ProMotion technology" which allows the display to switch variably between 10 fps and 120 frames per second...***

This qualified my logic in thinking this iPhone 13 "Pro Max" would significantly *outperform my experiences had with my Father's standard iPhone13*.

# Issues 

- The display has strong pink hue when viewed from the side-angles
- The display has an irregular refresh rate, producing scrolling "artifacts and jitter"
- The color of the display is not to standard
- The iPhone "settings" app is unsure of display as genuine & authentic

## The display:  

1. The display is not a Genuine Apple **OLED** display. It is a 3rd party **LCD** display.
1. This display's colors are not accurate. Also there is a color tint.
1. When viewed at an angle, the display is very pink and iridescent. It is also unreadable at moderate angles (angles that the genuine OLED screen perform at without issue and color problems).

iPhone13ProMax_issue

- The display has strong pink hue when viewed from the side-angles
- The display has an irregular refresh rate, producing scrolling "artifacts and jitter"
- The color of the display is not to standard
- The iPhone "settings" app is unsure of display as genuine & authentic
- Watching video (recorded on the phone at 24fps), the footage is so jittery it looks like 14 fps. I have to record at 60fps to get a less sloppy "less jittery" performance

I think is a refurbished iPhone with an unsatisfactory repair state…
I would like a refund or exchange to another phone (if you have any which are found satisfactory).

I came back to the shop on the same day I purchased the phone, unhappy with the refurbished screen.
I told them I want a refund. They say they cannot refund because there is no defect.

#### BEFORE PURCHASE:
- I was unaware the display was not only counterfeit/non-genuine,  but that it had significantly ‘decreased properties’,(brightness, color, refresh-rate, etc.)
- After requesting a refund [SUN 20 JUL @1740hrs] was finally told the display was not "genuine OLED", but in fact "LCD". The cheap type of LCD which changes color significantly at large viewing angles.
- I was unaware the device was refurbished. After snooping though the settings app, I found not only had the display been replaced, but a ‘battery’ and ‘camera module’ had also been replaced.
- This device seemed like a fair deal as other devices on trade me had sold for similar prices [[    Screenshot+     https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/iphone/iphone-13/listing/5418423801    https://web.archive.org/web/20250720080455/https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/iphone/iphone-13/listing/5418423801    ]]. Those other devices were non-refurbished however, and so my judgement was that the "device sold to me was comparable" in not only price but aspects such as whether the phone had been refurbished.

AFTER PURCHASE
- After refund was refused by seller, I had found their stock on trademe. Here the item is properly described…     ScreenShot+.        https://web.archive.org/web/20250720081416/https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/iphone/iphone-13-pro-max/listing/5426534915 
- I realise I was never aware of these alterations (which are visible clearly on trademe) made to the phone.
- I realise that the device in its current state "does not offer all of the features of a ‘normal’ and ‘complete’ phone would", especially when using apple’s "phone-comparison tool"  [[ ScreenShot+ /web/20250720084608/https://www.apple.com/ph/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-13-pro-max,iphone-13,iphone-16-pro-max ]]
